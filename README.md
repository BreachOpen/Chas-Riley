# Introduction
I chose the cybersecurity field due to my growth-focused mindset and a passion for understanding how complicated things function. To me, cybersecurity is a complex puzzle that is filled with constant challenges and accomplishments, fueling my drive to learn and improve. I believe we should all continuously seek knowledge and aim to be better each day. My past mentorship from exceptional leaders and the insights from subordinates have instilled in me a strong sense of integrity and a continuous pursuit of wisdom. I take pride in my work, understanding that it reflects my character, and I always strive to give my best effort, especially when my work impacts others. Helping others brings me genuine satisfaction, and I find it difficult not to assist those in need, especially when that help is needed by good people. I aim to surround myself with individuals who possess integrity and a mutual desire for success. For these reasons, I seek employment with an organization that prioritizes excellence and societal betterment.
