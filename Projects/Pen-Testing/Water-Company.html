    <div class="section overview">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on the authorized defensive penetration measures taken to defend the CyberApolis Municipal Water company from the terrorist group known as Carbon Spector. The report details the various phases of the penetration test, including reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, post-exploitation, and mitigation measures.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section simulation">
        <h2>Simulated Situation</h2>
        <p>The scenario involves a terrorist group taking control of the CyberApolis Municipal Water facility with the intent of flooding the city. The objective is to neutralize the threat by infiltrating the organizationâ€™s private server, gathering intelligence, and closing the dam floodgates to prevent disaster.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section objective">
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The objective of this penetration simulation is to assess the security posture of the CyberApolis Municipal Water company, identify vulnerabilities, and provide recommendations for mitigation. The report covers the following main topics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Executive Summary:</strong> Summarizes the findings and key actions taken during the penetration test.</li>
            <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Provides an overview of the incident and the immediate response by the security team.</li>
            <li><strong>Reconnaissance:</strong> Details the initial information gathering and identification of potential access points.</li>
            <li><strong>Scanning:</strong> Involves analyzing the website and network to identify vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploitation:</strong> Describes the methods used to exploit identified vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-Exploitation:</strong> Details the actions taken after gaining access to the system.</li>
            <li><strong>Summary and Mitigation:</strong> Summarizes the security setup and provides recommendations for improvement.</li>
            <li><strong>Synopsis:</strong> Offers a brief overview of the entire penetration test and its outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Appendix:</strong> Includes additional information and supporting documentation.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section tools">
        <h2>Tools Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Burp Suite:</strong> A comprehensive tool for web application security testing, used for scanning and exploiting vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Nmap:</strong> A network scanning tool used to discover hosts and services on a network.</li>
            <li><strong>John the Ripper:</strong> A password cracking tool used to recover passwords from password hashes.</li>
            <li><strong>Hydra:</strong> A tool for brute forcing login credentials on various protocols.</li>
            <li><strong>Wireshark:</strong> A network protocol analyzer used for capturing and analyzing network traffic.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section conclusion">
        <h2>Project Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The CyberApolis Water Breach Report provided valuable insights into the security vulnerabilities of the facility's systems. By following a structured penetration testing approach, critical flaws were identified and mitigated. The implementation of recommended security measures and regular assessments will significantly reduce the risk of future breaches.</p>
