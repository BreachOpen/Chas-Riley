## Digital Forensic Analysis and Suspect Linkage

In this exercise, I was tasked with conducting a digital forensics investigation on a recovered hard drive suspected to belong to an individual involved in a series of cybercrimes. The hard drive in question was found at a crime scene and contains potential evidence that could link the suspect to various criminal activities.

#### Objectives:

1. **Creating a Forensic Image of the Disk:**
   - **Tool Used:** FTK Imager
   - **Task:** Use FTK Imager to create a forensic image of the recovered hard drive. Ensure the integrity of the evidence by using appropriate settings for image creation.
